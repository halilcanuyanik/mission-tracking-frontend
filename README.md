## ðŸŽ¯ Motivation

This project was inspired by the need for a more efficient way to manage personnel and resources in mission-based operations.
Many organizations rely on manual processes or outdated tools that make coordination slow and error-prone.
By developing this application, the goal was to create an intuitive and responsive platform that ensures smooth task assignments and real-time availability updates.
